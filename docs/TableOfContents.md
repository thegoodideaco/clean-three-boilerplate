### Loaders and Asset Helpers

These are custom loaders and asset helpers that are used to load and manage assets in the application. They extend the original loaders, but include additional functionality to make it easier to load assets and manage them in the application.

Each loader provides a list of paths to any available files that each loader can load. The loaders are used to load assets in the application, and the asset helpers are used to manage the assets in the application.
